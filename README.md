In this analysis, it is expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation based on riding data.

In the analysis, a company's complete recordset of rides is provided. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The main ojective of the project is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

As final considerations, the following items will be taken into account:

* Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Matplotlib library.
* A written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
* Aesthetics visualization!
* Pyber color scheme (Gold, SkyBlue, and Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.
* Experiment with effects like `alpha`, `edgecolor`, and `linewidths`.
* Experiment with effects like `shadow`, `startangle`, and `explosion`.
